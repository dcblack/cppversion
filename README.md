Everything in this project is effectively self-contained in the single source-file `cppversion.cpp` including the instructions.

Note that it has been updated to make it compatible with SystemC usage.

Read, compile, execute, and enjoy! If you have any comments, observed bugs (please tell me your configuration), or suggestions for improvement, feel free to submit an issue.
